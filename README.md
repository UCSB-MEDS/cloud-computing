# An Intro to Cloud Computing for Data Science
**Presenter:** Sam Csik   
**Organization:** UCSB MEDS  
**Date:** April 18, 2022  
**Duration:** ~2 hrs

*The Cloud* is a buzzword we often hear, but maybe don't quite understand. In this workshop, we'll learn a bit about what cloud computing means and can look like, how to launch a virtual machine (i.e. an instance) using Amazon Web Services (AWS), and how we can leverage more powerful computers (e.g. the cloud) to run computationally-intensive processes in less time.

Looking to jump straight into launching your first Amazon EC2 instance? Find documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bxp7OMq1_d1l7sMD7qoh8c8cA0rhYIGx-nr4IchH98E/edit?usp=sharing).
